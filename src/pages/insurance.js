          I am an in-network provider for the NYU Student Health Insurance,
          Wellfleet (previous known as CHP). Students who have this insurance
          are responsible for the co-insurance or copayment at the end of each
          session.
        </p>
        <p>
          For all other individuals, we establish the mutually-agreed upon fee
          during the consultation appointment. I do offer a select amount of
          lower fee slots, though these are determined by my current
          availability and oneâ€™s financial circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also qualify as an out-of-network provider for most insurance plans
          that provide such coverage and I am happy to provide all the necessary
          information for out-of-network benefit insurance submissions. If you
          may be interested in using out-of-network benefits, some useful
          questions to ask your health insurance company are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Do I have out-of-network benefits?</li>
          <li>If yes, do I have an out-of-network deductible?</li>
          <li>
            After I meet the deductible (if applicable), what percentage do you
            reimburse for an outpatient mental health psychotherapy session? &
            What is your maximum allowed amount for an outpatient mental health
            psychotherapy session?
          </li>
          <li>Do I have an out-of-network out-of-pocket maximum?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I have happy to review any questions you might have about fee or
          insurance during the consultation appointment as well.
