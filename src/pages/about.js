          I am licensed counseling psychologist and received my PhD from New
          York University (NYU) Steinhardt. In regards to my training, I
          completed my APA-accredited internship at Harvard Medical
          School/Cambridge Health Alliance where I received specialized training
          in how to work with people with complex trauma, substance use
          disorders, LGBTQ+ concerns, family conflict, relationship problems,
          depression, anxiety, and immigration stressors from
          psychodynamically-informed treatment approaches. I also completed a
          postdoctoral fellowship at NYU Counseling and Wellness Services where
          I worked with graduate and undergraduate students from a short-term
          psychodynamic approach. While in graduate school, I trained in a
          variety of settings as well, including: Pace University Counseling
          Center, the Addiction Institute of New York at Mount Sinai West
          Hospital (formerly Roosevelt Hospital), and Kings County Hospital.

          I also regularly serve as an adjunct instructor in NYU Steinhardtâ€™s
          Department of Applied Psychology and teach masters-level courses to
          students in the mental health counseling and drama therapy programs. I
          graduated with a Bachelors of Science in human development from
          Cornell University.
