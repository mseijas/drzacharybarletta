        <h2>Approach & Expertise</h2>
        <p>
          I work with young adults and adults from a
          psychodynamic/attachment-based perspective, meaning I am very
          interested in exploring how early experiences in our families,
          communities, and larger contexts impact our sense of ourselves, our
          relationships, and our world, sometimes in ways outside of our
          awareness. At the heart of my work, I strive to create empathetic
          connections with the individuals I work with--- creating spaces for
          them to explore and express all of themselves, and to feel seen,
          understood, and connected while doing so. I often help individuals
          recognize unhelpful or hindering patterns in their lives and enable
          them to develop new and more fulfilling ways to navigate these
          challenges. Additionally, I commonly emphasize the use of
          self-compassion as we uncover potentially difficult or problematic
          areas of oneâ€™s past and present.
